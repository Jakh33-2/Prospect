A connection to the server is served over a secured connection. The server uses self-signed certificate that must be added to trusted authorities in order for the game

    1. Select **Current User** under Store Location and click **Next**.

    1. Leave **File to Import** unchanged and click **Next**.

    1. Leave **Password** empty and click **Next**.

    1. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** > **Browse...**. Choose **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and click **OK**. Click **Next**.

    1. Click **Finish**. A Security Warning popup may appear, make sure it specifies `2EA46.playfabapi.com` certification authority and click **Yes**.

### 5. Add `steam_appid.txt` to the game

1. Open the folder with The Cycle: Frontier and navigate to **Prospect** > **Binaries** > **Win64**.

1. Right-click in the folder > **New** > **Text Document**, and name it `steam_appid.txt`.

1. Open `steam_appid.txt` and enter `480`.

1. Save and close the file.

### 6. Create a game shortcut with

1. Right-click the created shortcut > **Properties**.

1. In the **Target** field, add the following parameters after the quote ` -empty -server -log -windowed -noeac -nointro -steam_auth PF_TITLEID=2EA46`. Note the space after the quote.

1. Move the shortcut to desktop.

### 7. Run the server

### 8. Run the game

### Troubleshooting and FAQ

#### How to remove the certificate?

If you've installed the certificate for the **Current User**:

1. Open **Start** and enter `certmgr.msc`.

1. Expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and select **Certificates**.

1. Find `2EA46.playfabapi.com`, right-click it > **Delete**.

If you've installed the certificate for the **Local Machine**, repeat the same steps but instead open `certlm.msc`.

#### `generate_ssl.exe` is flagged as a virus

`generate_ssl.exe` is a Python application packed with PyInstaller and some anti-viruses may flag it as a virus.
This application is a simple certificate generator and you can find its source code in `utils/generate_ssl.py`.
